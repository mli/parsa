The repository implemented Parsa from the following paper

Build and Run:

1. Build parameter server by following the [[https://github.com/mli/parameter_server/blob/master/README.org][guide]]
2. Clone this repository in the parameter server directory (or change =PS_PATH=
   in =Makefile= accordingly)
3. Build parsa by =make -j8=
4. Download data by =example/download_ctr.sh=
5. Test 2 servers and 2 workers in local =../script/local.sh ./parsa 2 2 -app_file example/ctr.conf=

Some known issues:

1. This implementation handles general uint64 keys. A implementation which
   assume continuous keys can be much faster.
2. One need to change the configuration at the head of =parsa.h= to obtain more than
   16 partitions.
3. `partitionU` may be hung if assign too many blocks to one worker.
